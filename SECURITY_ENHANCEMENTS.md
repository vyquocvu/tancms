# TanCMS Security Enhancement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive security enhancements implemented for TanCMS as part of issue #26. All changes follow minimal-modification principles while significantly strengthening the security posture.

## Security Features Implemented

### üîí Input Sanitization (`app/lib/security/sanitization.ts`)
- **HTML Entity Encoding**: Prevents XSS attacks by encoding dangerous characters
- **HTML Sanitization**: Configurable HTML cleaning with allowed tags and attributes
- **URL Validation**: Prevents malicious redirects and javascript: URLs
- **File Upload Security**: Secure filename handling and MIME type validation
- **JSON Input Cleaning**: Recursive sanitization for complex data structures
- **Field-Type Specific Sanitization**: Tailored cleaning based on content type

### üõ°Ô∏è CSRF Protection (`app/lib/security/csrf.ts`)
- **Double-Submit Cookie Pattern**: Industry-standard CSRF protection
- **Origin Validation**: Additional protection against cross-origin attacks
- **Token Rotation**: New tokens generated on each request
- **Automatic Protection**: Applied to all state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Form Token Support**: Special handling for form-based submissions

### üîê Security Headers (`app/server/security-headers.ts`)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS and injection attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Clickjacking protection
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: MIME sniffing protection
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls referrer information leakage
- **Permissions Policy**: Restricts browser feature access
- **Strict Transport Security**: HTTPS enforcement in production
- **Rate Limiting**: API abuse protection with configurable limits

### üîë Enhanced Authentication (`app/server/security-auth.ts`)
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Comprehensive password validation with scoring
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Session Fingerprinting**: Additional session security validation
- **IP-Based Tracking**: Monitor login attempts by IP address
- **Security Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of security events
- **Secure Token Generation**: Cryptographically secure random tokens

### New Endpoints
- **`app/routes/api/security/audit.ts`**: Admin-only security monitoring
  - Failed login attempts tracking
  - User activity monitoring
  - Security event audit trail

- **`app/routes/api/health.ts`**: System health monitoring
  - Database connectivity checks
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Security configuration validation
  - Session cleanup status

## Testing
