The recommended approach is to focus on high-impact features first (rich text
editing, content workflow, search) before expanding to advanced features. This
will provide the most value to users while building toward feature parity with
Strapi.

The modern technology stack gives TanCMS advantages in performance and developer
experience, which should be leveraged during feature development to create a
superior alternative to traditional headless CMS solutions.
