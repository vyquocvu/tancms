## Success Metrics

### Short-term (6 months)

- Feature parity score: 45+ features (67% parity)
- User satisfaction: 80%+ in user testing
- Performance: Maintain sub-200ms API response times

### Medium-term (12 months)

- Feature parity score: 55+ features (82% parity)
- Community adoption: 1000+ GitHub stars
- Production deployments: 100+ active installations

### Long-term (18 months)

- Feature parity score: 60+ features (90% parity)
- Market position: Recognized Strapi alternative
- Enterprise adoption: 10+ enterprise customers

## Investment Recommendation

### ROI Analysis

- **High ROI**: Quick wins provide immediate value with minimal investment
- **Medium ROI**: Core features address 80% of user needs
- **Strategic ROI**: Advanced features enable enterprise market entry

### Recommended Investment Level

- **Conservative**: Focus on Quick Wins + Phase 1 (12 months, moderate budget)
- **Balanced**: Complete Phases 1-2 (18 months, significant budget)
- **Aggressive**: Full feature parity in 24 months (high budget, market
  leadership potential)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. Prioritize quick wins based on user feedback
2. Set up development infrastructure for parallel feature development
3. Create detailed technical specifications for Phase 1 features
